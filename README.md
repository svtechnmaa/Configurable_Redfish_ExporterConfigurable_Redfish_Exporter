# Configurable Redfish Exporter

The End goal is a Prometheus exporter that can automatically create server metric base on Redfish API and JSON Metric mapping configuration.
This is a Next Generation that include two main functions:
- Redfish Collector: We collect all devices that defined in inventory and reconstruct model.
- Prometheus Exporter: We use new model from Redfish Collector to generate prometheus metrics, response them when prometheus server call.

Folder structure should as follow:
- source code
- configuration file for mapping logic from individual vendor to common YAML/JSON schema
- configuration file for mapping logic from common YAML/JSON schema to exporter metric
- deployment files

## Guide:
#### Create Exporter
There're two ways that you can use Redfish-Exporter:
* Using Container Images:
  - Pull Redfish Exporter images via `docker pull` command (if you're using docker):

    ``` bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/svtechnmaa/redfish-exporter:<version>
    ```

    Run `docker run` command if you use Docker:

    ``` bash
    docker run -d --name <your exporter name> -p 9814:9814 redfish-exporter:<version>
    ```

* Runing with source:
  - You should install python library that included in requirement.txt
  - Just run `Uvicorn` in source directory:
    
    ``` bash
    uvicorn redfish_collector.main:app --host="0.0.0.0" --port=9814 --log-config="redfish_collector/logging/logging.yml"
    ```

#### Config Structure

* Structure:

  ```
  templates/
  |-- configs
  |   |-- inventory.yml                            ### Define devices that need for collecting, you can check example
  |   `-- sample.yml                               ### Define metrics using for prometheus metrics
  `-- schemas
      |-- Common.yml                               ### Schema that get common information for all vendor server (of course with Redfish DMTF supporting)
      |-- DellPowerEdgeR630.yml                    ### Schema that get vendor information
      |-- DellPowerEdgeR650.yml                    ### ...       
      |-- DellPowerEdgeR750.yml
      |-- HPEProLiantGen10.yml
      `-- HPEProLiantGen9.yml
  ```

#### Pull metrics from Redfish Exporter
You need to have Prometheus Server or Victoria or else, change configuration on config file:
* For example:
  
    ```
    global:
      scrape_interval: 2m 
      evaluation_interval: 30s
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "prometheus"
      static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
    - job_name: 'node_proxmox'
      scrape_interval: 3m
      scrape_timeout: 2m
      params:
        serverAddress: ['<server-idrac-or-ilo-ip>']
        config: ['sample']
      static_configs:
      - targets: ["<exporter-ip>:9814"]
    ```

#### Query metrics for testing
You can use `curl` command to query server for testing data:
* For example:

    ```bash
    curl -XGET 'http://<exporter-ip>:<exporter-port>/metrics?serverAddress=<server-ip>&config=<file name in config dir>'
    ```

Other way you can connect to FastAPI doc WebUI:
* For example:

    ```bash
    http://<exporter-ip>:<exporter-port>/docs
    ```

#### Compare raw data with new data
As you know data collected from vendors are different models, so we need convert them to models that defined in schema.
For troubleshooting, you can go into exporter container with `/bin/sh` and check in `/tmp` directory:
* For example:

    ```bash
    docker exec exporter /bin/sh -c 'ls /tmp/refish-data/RawData/'
    
    docker exec exporter /bin/sh -c 'ls /tmp/refish-data/NewData/'

    10.97.12.1.json    10.97.12.3.json    10.97.99.1.json
    10.97.12.1.json    10.97.12.3.json    10.97.99.1.json

    docker exec exporter /bin/sh -c 'cat /tmp/refish-data/RawData/10.97.99.1.json'

    docker exec exporter /bin/sh -c 'cat /tmp/refish-data/NewData/10.97.99.1.json'
    ```
